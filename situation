10.09.2021 and 30.09.2021 20m resolution files cant open in SNAP or in QGIS (only band 11 files are opened). 
SNAP sentinel plugins cant run correctly.
10m resolution files (both dates): SNAP read those files uncorrectly, dont recognize as a S2A satellite images.
QGIS sentinel 2 cloud mask plugin cant run because of ee module. No solution.
I resampled 20 m resolution band 11 images and stack with the 10 m resolution bands 2, 3, 4, 8. That was the only logical way.
I tried some solutions assisted by github repositories and stackoverflow but they didnt work either. (python based libraries etc.)
I wanted to use supervised classification but files didnt run correctly. 
I did stack bands, resample, normalization.
I know the classification methos, TDP process but i couldnt perform them due to problems.
I thought using interferometry to work on the volcanic area (eruption, lava flow etc.), but i dont have the precise data.
If there was time to communicate in the normal process, I could fix some of them. Sorry for that.
