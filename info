Firstly, i used python (rasterio - jupyter notebook) for some image preprocessing.
Reprojection is not necessary. 
And then i used snap and QGIS to perform image processing. 
I stacked the bands 2, 3, 4, 8 and 11 (resampled) as 10m resolution.
I integrated the la palma bounds geojson file to the QGIS using Open Data Source Manager-Vector-Protocol
I clipped the data using QGIS python plugin called "GDAL Raster Cutter"
Normalization should be in 0-255 DN because image bit should be 8. If we chose this range and classification classes extend.
I changed extension of la_palma_bound geojson file to shapefile.



*I could done cloud masking with QGIS or SNAP but i had a problem with config files. 
**Plugins didn't work correctly even though i tried so hard to fix them with checking 
modules and other python code issues in a limited time. 
***Unfortunately I don't have access to ESRI's packages. I would like to perform some operations via ArcGIS.
****I would like to proceed by contacting you, but the spam incident unfortunately did not make this possible.
